👋 Hi, I’m Arinbjörn

🔎 I’m interested in machine learning for health, specifically high-frequency wearable sensors, brain MRI and genetic data.

<!-- 🌱 I’m currently working at Evidation Health and am an Honorary Research Associate at Imperial College London. -->

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development of models, tools and libraries on machine learning in health.
