👋 Hi, I’m Arinbjörn

🔎 I’m interested in machine learning for health, specifically high-frequency wearable sensors, brain MRI and genetic data.

🌱 Currently, I’m a visiting scholar at the University of Virginia and bulding something new.

💬 Let’s collaborate on machine learning applications in health or discuss ideas for impactful AI.
